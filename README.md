### Android application made for university project. 

Featuring stuff like:
  * social network (users, followers, messages, comments, likes)
  * custom view for meme generation (type caption, swipe to scale, drag to move)
  * firebase auth, firebase database, firebase storage (firebase all the things)
  * sloppy hacked code (time is precious)
